    <h1>DRILLING AND BORING TOOLS</h1>

    <section class="tool-description">
        <h2>Bradwal</h2>
        <p>A small, handheld tool with a pointed awl for making pilot holes for screws or nails. Think of it as a mini drill you push by hand.</p>

    <section class="tool-description">
        <h2>Carpenters Brace</h2>
        <p>A cranked device that holds various drill bits (like augers) for creating larger holes in wood. It offers more power and control than a hand drill. Imagine a T-shaped handle you crank to rotate a bigger drill bit.</p>

    <section class="tool-description">
        <h2>Auger Bit</h2>
        <p>A drill bit with a screw-like design that bores wide, clean holes in wood. Useful for tasks like installing doorknobs or running thick cables. Think of it as a corkscrew for wood.</p>

    <section class="tool-description">
        <h2>Hand Drill</h2>
        <p>A simple handheld drill with a chuck that holds smaller bits. You spin it by hand for light drilling tasks in wood, plastic, or soft materials. Imagine a small eggbeater you use for drilling.</p>
